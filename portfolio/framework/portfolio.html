        <p class="setparagraph">I am currently pursuing my bachelor’s degree in computer science with concentration as Information Technology from Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago with graduation date of May 2016.  This degree has given me experience with programming, database development, and web development. I have worked with different languages for school projects including Java, Javascript, Jquery and SQL.</p>
      	<p>I have different projects during my bachelor’s program, which are as follows:
      		<ul class="style">
				<li>	Designed coded and tested from scratch a web page for the computer science department. This webpage contains important course related information for students interested in learning about courses related to the Information Technology concentration.</li>
				<li>	Conceptualized designed and coded a database for a banking system using Oracle 11g as the database and Oracle SQL Developer as the tool.</li>
				<li>	Created bouncing ball project using Java and JFrame.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
      	<p>I have experience in using tools like: <ul>
      												<li> JGrasp</li>
      												<li>IntelliJIdea</li>
      												<li> Oracle SQL Developer</li>
      												<li>Titanium 9</li>
      											</ul>
      	</p>
        <p>I also have done my bachelor’s in Botany (Honors.) from Banaras Hindu University, India. This degree has given me good knowledge in the field of Botany.  I completed Botany bachelor’s with a very good CGPA of 8.45/10.</p>
        <p>I got my interest in drawing and painting because of my mother who always makes beautiful paintings to decorate our house and for friends. I have participated in many art competitions to show my skills. From very young age I became found of using Internet as many other teenagers, and at that time I used to wonder how the beautiful web sites are created. When I started learning making designs and pictures using designing tools and different programming language, then I decided to change my field to computer science. </p>
        <p>Today, I am designing my own webpages and website using the skills and knowledge that I have been learning in Computer Science. I am looking forward to gain more knowledge in computer science through this degree. </p>
