                     to decorate our house and for friends. I have participated in many art competitions to show my skills. From very young age I became found of using Internet as many other teenagers, and at that time I used to wonder how the beautiful web sites are created. When I started learning making designs and pictures using designing tools and different programming language, then I decided to change my field to computer science.

                     in Computer Science.I am looking forward to gain more knowledge in computer science through this degree.
